#Lab 11 and Lab 12

## Lab 11: Spring for Full-Stack Web Apps

### How to Run
    - In the IDE build and run the SongrApplication class. 
    - This application can then be accessed by navigating to localhost:8080 where you can interact with the routes.
    
## Lab 12: Spring and Rest

### How to run the application
    - The Routes Available:
        /albums     --will show you all of the albums available
        /albums/{id#}   --will show you albums by id
        /albums/create  --navigate here by entering in new album data and adding it to the database from /albums.
    
## Lab 13: Related Resources and Integration Tests
    This lab is currently not going well for me at all. I am completely lost and am going to spend the weekend redoing
    labs and trying to understand this. I have watched the front row video over and over again and this is just not making 
    sense. 
    I will resubmit these assignments when I get something or anything working because I cannot even get anything to add
     to the database currently.
    
### How to run the application
    - Currently you cannot run the application. You should be able to hit build and run the code. This will start the
     server and add infformation to the database which will show through the album template.
     
     - Lab requires that the application should be run using a single gradle command and I have not even gotten far 
     enough to look at or understand this portion yet.
