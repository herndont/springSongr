#Lab 11 and Lab 12

## Lab 11: Spring for Full-Stack Web Apps

### How to Run
    - In the IDE build and run the SongrApplication class. 
    - This application can then be accessed by navigating to localhost:8080 where you can interact with the routes.
    
## Lab 12: Spring and Rest

### How to run the application
    - That is a really good question. Will get back to you on that later.
